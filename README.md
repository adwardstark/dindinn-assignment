### Notes

---

 - The network layer is mocked in debug-mode and the data will be loaded from `src/main/assets` directory. You can add/modify items by updating `orders.json` and `ingredients.json` file respectively.

 - Unit tests were not added because the mentioned cases belong to instrumentation tests.
